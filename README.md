# About

This repo holds code to produce animated line graphs of the emotional arc of stories, like the one below for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

Note that I have not included any epubs in this repository so that I am not illegally distributing copywrited content. If you use this code, you will of course have to download the epubs or get the text of the story some other way yourself.

Happy plotting!
